# Autofocus

Autofocus simulates the procces through which a camera focuses on a specific object.

## How to run the program

In order to run the program on a certain photo you have to type the path to ```focustest.py``` and the name of the photo with space in between them like in this example: ```./Autofocus/focustest.py <photo_name>```.

After running the previous commands close the original picture which will show up on your screen, then follow the instructions that appear in the terminal.

The Autofocus repository contains a bunch of sample pictures to showcase the functionality. However, if you want to test it on another picture, you will have to save it in the same folder as the ```focustest.py``` executable.

### WARNING
The pictures must have a reasonable contrast which means they shouldn't be completely white or black.

## Requirements

Assuming that you have already installed python3, you will also need to install some libraries by typing the following command: ```pip install <library name>```, in the console.

The name of the libraries are: 
- PILLOW 
- matplotlib
- numpy
- opencv
